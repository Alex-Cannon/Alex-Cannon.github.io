Want to get into Software Development? This post is for you. In this blog I'll talk about the steps you can take to get a job as a software developer. It is challenging to get into the industry so I hope this information will be valuable to you.

A little bit of background about me: My name is Alex Cannon. I've been teaching myself software developement for the past 2 years and I'm excited to say I've accepted a DevOps internship that I hope will transition into a job. I create videos and blogs about software development so [subscribe](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLX0n9oWmGkjKmK8iuPf8wQ?view_as=subscriber) if you'd like to hear more from me.

If you're like me, maybe you taught yourself. Maybe you went to college or went through a bootcamp. There's a lot of content out there on advice for getting a software developer job. Let's make this simple. Here's my advice in one sentence:

_You need **Experience**._

Yep. Getting a job as a developer is that simple. Get experience. Even junior/entry-level developers and interns need experience. **Yes, even interns need experience!** Gauge how much experience you need by looking at job boards.

_"Hey! That's a catch-22. I can't get experience without a job."  --Jane Doe_

Who said you need a job to get experience? I imagine you have some skill if you're reading this. Now, you need to use it. Below are ways you can gain experience.

1. <u>Write Software for people</u>
    * Write Software for non-profits.
        * Fastest way to start writing software for people.
        * They aren't worried about deadlines.
        * Volunteer work looks good on your resume.
    * Write Software for acquaintances.
        * Why don't I write software for family/friends? Because I don't want to lose family/friends. It's OK if your relationship turns sour for an acquaintances.
    * Write Software for businesses.
        * At this point, you could create a business-as entity and **all of the sudden, you're working as a developer for your business-as entity.** Now, if an employer asks, you should tell them yes, you own the business. <u>Don't lie</u>. The whole point is to gain experience, not decieve people. 
        * It can be difficult to get customers, especially since you don't have experience. Try to network. Go to meetups and ask people how _you_ can help _them_.
        * You _may_ have to charge less. But, remember, you're doing _them_ a favor. You're work _is_ valuable.
2. <u>Write Software for practice</u>
    * Tutorials do NOT count. Monkeys can follow tutorials. You aren't a monkey, are you? Show me you aren't.
    * Any software your write for practice should be a project. What do I consider a project?
        1. Must do _something_!
        2. Must be **complete!**
        3. Try to make it _different_ and _more_ impressive than other people's projects.
        4. For example, I worked with a team to clone airbnb. How many people have cloned airbnb? Not a lot. Of course we could've made our own _creative_ project that would have been _more_ different and/or impressive.

Simple, right? So, you have 2 options to get experience. <b>I highly, highly recommend that you <u>write software for people.</u></b> It is tremendously more valuable than writing software for practice.

Think about this: You're a business. Who would you pick:

A developer who...
1. Has built software for other people/businesses.
2. Has built software, that, _in theory_, should work for your business.

I agree. I'd pick #1 too. Now that you know **what** you need to do, you need to figure out **how** you're going to do it. Again, it's simple. **Make a Plan.**

You know yourself best. Don't plan for 5 hours a day of development when you know you're really only going to do 2. Make a plan you feel is _achievable_ and _worth_ your hard work and time.

Your plan should be [SMART](https://www.smartsheet.com/blog/essential-guide-writing-smart-goals) and...

1. Have _daily, weekly, monthly, and annual_ goals.
2. Have a step-by-step guide on how you're going to get yourself into a position where you are writing software for people/practice.
3. Have a list of technologies you plan to learn/get more experience in. **Look at a job description for the role you're aiming for** to learn what technologies employers need you to know.
4. Be measuarable. "I want to get 20 commits this month" is measurable. "I want to do some commits this month" is not measurable.
5. Keep yourself accountable. Mayble even throw in a reward if you reach your goals. Treat yourself to a nice steak.
6. Be flexible. You may need to change bits and pieces as you go. Do it if you feel you need to.

Great! **Now you have a plan to get experienced!** Commit to it, then you'll get the experience you need. 

Now, **there are more steps you need to take to get a job** that we won't get into in this blog post. If you liked the post, feel free to request another topic by messaging me. Below are other topics I can talk about:
