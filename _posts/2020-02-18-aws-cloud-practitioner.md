Amazon Web Service certificates are industry-recognized credentials to help you grow you career. Whether you’re a System Admin, Software Developer, DevOps Engineer, or a IT Professional, AWS certificates are worth every penny.

In this post, I’ll review the [AWS Cloud Practitioner](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/) certification and share the steps I took to pass the exam.

For a full list of certifications offered by AWS, see the [AWS Certification Overview page](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/).

## Review
Recently, I was certified as a AWS Cloud Practitioner ([see my certificate here](https://www.certmetrics.com/amazon/public/badge.aspx?i=9&t=c&d=2020-02-13&ci=AWS01280399)).

The AWS Cloud Practitioner certification covers “fundamental AWS Cloud and industry knowledge” –AWS Certification overview page.

For example, the certification covers topics such as Elasticity, Auto-Scaling, billing, and other Cloud / AWS related topics.

Students will gain a high-level understanding of AWS Services and Solutions for common use-cases. The certification does not require in-depth technical expertise. Instead, it is accessible to all audiences including business professionals.

The higher-tier certs, such as the Developer Associate certification, are geared toward folks with more technical expertise.

As a business professional, the cert will enable you to make smarter business decisions with your IT team.

As a developer or IT professional, the certification will give you the foundational knowledge needed before you dive deep into the technical details of AWS services.

## Worth your time?
All in all, I recommend the AWS Cloud Practitioner certification to IT & business professionals in the IT industry.

## Study Guide
*Refer to the official AWS Certification Prep page for up-to-date information.

Personally, I took these two steps to pass the exam:

1. Listened to 6 hours of official AWS Cloud Practitioner video content.
    * This was beneficial as far as learning basic AWS concepts.
    * Didn’t do much to help me pass the exam.
2. Purchased a Cloud Practitioner Practice Exam course on Udemy by TutorialsDojo.
    * Recommended to me from 2 Developer Team Leads.
    * 4 practice tests and flash-cards.
    * Detailed feedback on incorrect questions.
    * Tests are more difficult than the exam.
    * Lets you know what kind of score you’ll get on the actual exam.
    * Monthly updates.
3. Once I passed all 4 test exams, I took the exam and passed on my first try.
    * Also, you can take the test at home or at a testing center. Personally, I took the test at a testing center to avoid any technical issues at home.

Additionally, you can download the official exam guide, sample questions, and white papers on the AWS certification prep page.

## Conclusion
I hope I convinced you to get AWS Cloud Practitioner certified! All in all, I think it’s worth your time to get certified.
