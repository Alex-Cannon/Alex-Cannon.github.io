## Preface

Hi! I'm Alex Cannon. I create blog content to help developers like you improve their code, learn new topics, and more. **I recently accepted a job offer as a `Junior Software Engineer` so I figured I could help someone else land a job too.**

I didn't get my first job alone. I had many [mentors](#mentors) and [books](#books) help my along the way. I'll leave references to them at the bottom of this article so you can check them out.

I'd also like to thank the good folks at [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) for all their hard work creating a community of learners and an excellent curriculum.
