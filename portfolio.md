  <p>I've had the privilege of working with some great developers during a few <a href="https://chingu.io/" rel="noreferer noopener">Chingu Voyages</a>. Chingu connects learners into teams in order for motivated developers to learn and complete awesome projects together.</p>
  <p>I'm always looking for ways to get involved in the software development community. I attend monthly hackathons/meetups where I can geek-out and have some fun!</p>
  <p>Writing software is superb. But <b>I also understand that at the end of the day, businesses need to make money!</b> That is why I'm commited to learning what is necessary to get the job done.</p>

  <h4>Testimonials</h4>
  <p><i>Alex and I worked on a two months remote full stack development project together. Alex was the team leader and was very organized and productive for the whole duration of the project. Because of Alex's focus and coding skills our group was able to finish the project in the allocated time and fulfill all of our goals. Alex is very knowledgable with the MERN stack and a great problem solver. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/inna-leikina-1580542b/" rel="noreferer noopener">-Inna Leikina</a></i></p>
